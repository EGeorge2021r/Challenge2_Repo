# Loan Qualifier Application

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans.

An application developer at fintech lending startup, was tasked with adding a new high priority feature that can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.  This project is an excellent way for the developer to demonstrate his skills in his new fintech career.

The main contribution or user story for the project is as follows:

Role: Biz operation

Goal: Create an enhancement in the software that will prompt the user to save the qualifying loan as a new CSV file.

Reason: To demonstrate the new software engineersâ€™ skills in fintech career

## Technologies
The programming language used for this project is Python 3.9. In addition, the following python libraries were imported and used in the coding:
1. Fire
2. Questionary
3. pathlib
4. csv library 
frameworks
Windows 10 operating system used in executing the python coding.  
git bash and VS code which has a built in CLI and libraries are used for the project.

This project leverages python 3.9 with the following packages:

* [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - For the command line interface, help page, and entrypoint.

* [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) - For interactive user prompts and dialogs

For project visibilty and information sharing a repository was created in GitHub for tthis project named Challenge2_Repo.

pip fire installation
Python Fire is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from python object. This can be installed in one of the following ways:
To install Python Fire from pypi, run:
pip install fire
Alternatively, to install Python Fire from source, clone the source and run:
python setup.py install

pip questionary installation
Use the package manager pip to install Questionary:
$ pip install questionary

## Usage
An sample screenshot of the usage and the block code are shown below:
The easiest way to use Fire is to take any Python program, and then simply call fire.Fire() at the end of the program. This will expose the full contents of the program to the command line. An sample block code of fire usage is shown below:

import fire

def hello(name):
  return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire()

An sample screenshot of questionary usage and the block code are shown below:

Code blocks:
import questionary

 ans_path = questionary.path("What file path do you want to save qualifying loans?").ask()
    # user to write in the file path
ans_savefile = questionary.confirm("Do you want to save this file?").ask()
    if ans_savefile == True: 
        save_csv(qualifying_loans)
