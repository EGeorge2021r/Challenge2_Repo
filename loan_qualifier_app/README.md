# Loan Qualifier Application

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans.

An application developer at fintech lending startup, was tasked with adding a new high priority feature that can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.  This project is an excellent way for the developer to demonstrate his skills in his new fintech career.
The main contribution or user story for the project is as follows:

Role: Biz operation

Goal: Create an enhancement in the software that will prompt the user to save the qualifying loan as a new CSV file.

Reason: To demonstrate the new software engineersâ€™ skills in fintech career
